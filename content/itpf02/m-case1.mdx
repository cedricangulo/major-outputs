title: Case 1

#### Problem

A store wants to manage its inventory of products across 3 branches.

Write a program that will:

1. Use a 2D array to store the stock quantities of each product in each branch.
2. Allow the user to input the stock quantities for all products in all branches.
3. Display the stock quantities in a tabular format.

Calculate and display:

**Total stock of each product across all branches**.

**Total stock in each branch**.

**The overall stock in the store**.

package case1;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Case1 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner kb = new Scanner(System.in); // Create a Scanner object for input
        int[][] stock = new int[4][3]; // 2D array to store stock quantities for 4 branches and 3 products

        // Input stock quantities
        for (int branch = 0; branch < 4; branch++) { // Loop through each branch
            System.out.println("Enter stock quantities for Branch " + (branch + 1) + ":");

            }
        }
