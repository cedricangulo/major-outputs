### What is a Server?

A **server** is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program.

#### Server vs. Personal Computer

| Feature           | Personal Computer                                                                 | Server                                                                                     |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use Time**      | Not built to run continuously                                                    | Built to run continuously                                                                  |
| **Storage**       | Consumer disks (HDD or SSD)                                                     | Hot-swappable drives (disks you can replace while running) and RAID (a system using many disks to protect data) |
| **Processor**     | Intel Core (i5, i7, i9) or AMD Ryzen                                             | Intel Xeon                                                                                |
| **Software**      | Windows 10/11 or standard Linux                                                 | Windows Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or FreeBSD                                      |

### Databases and Web Tools

- **Database**: A neat collection of organized information stored in a computer system.
- **DBMS**: A Database Management System (DBMS) is the software used to control a database. Examples include MySQL, Oracle, and MongoDB.
- **Web Server (Apache)**: Software that shows website content by processing and sending webpages to users.
- **PHP**: A coding language (scripting language) used for web development that fits inside HTML.
- **XAMPP**: A tool that includes Apache, MariaDB, PHP, and Perl.
- **MariaDB**: A database that works just like MySQL but is slightly faster for searching and copying data.

### Important Server Settings (php.ini)

Changing these settings helps keep your server safe.

| Setting              | Default | New Security Setup                                |
|----------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| display_errors       | On      | Off (hides code errors from users)                |
| expose_php           | On      | Off (hides that you are using PHP)                |
| allow_url_fopen      | On      | Off (stops the server from opening outside links) |
| memory_limit         |         | (limits the memory a script can use)              |
| max_execution_time   |         | (stops scripts if they run too long)              |

### Using .htaccess for Control

The **.htaccess** file handles specific tasks for your website:

- Moving users to a different page (redirecting).
- Blocking users by their IP (Internet Protocol address).
- Making website addresses (URLs) look cleaner.

#### URL Cleaning Example

You can use a command (directive) called `RewriteRule` to hide file endings:

- `RewriteEngine On`: Turns on the tool that changes URLs.
- `RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f`: Checks if the requested name is not a real file.
- `^([^\.]+)$`: A pattern that looks for text without a period.
- `$1.php`: Adds ".php" to the end of the web address automatically.
