#### Administrative Setup (XAMPP)

We configured `xampp-control.exe` to Run as Administrator.

- Why: This gives the software the required permissions to manage Apache and MySQL services.
- Result: It prevents the system from blocking the control panel when starting or stopping services, making it easier to exit the program completely.

#### File Structure & Mapping

We created a folder named `mywebsite` inside `htdocs`.

- Index Files: We observed that naming a file `index.php` allows the browser to load it automatically without typing the filename in the URL.
- Directory Listing: When we renamed the file, the browser showed a list of all files in the folder. This is a security risk called Information Gathering.
- Mapping: This exercise showed how attackers can see the "topographical points" (files and folders) of an application.

#### Securing the Server with .htaccess

To prevent people from seeing our file list, we used a configuration file called `.htaccess`.

- Disabling Indexes: We added `Options -Indexes` to hide the file list from the public.
- URL Cleaning: We used the following code to hide the `.php` extension, making the application harder to fingerprint:

```apache title=".htaccess" lineNumbers
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.php -f
RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)$ $1.php [NC,L]

Options -Indexes
```

#### Database User Management (phpMyAdmin)

We practiced securing the database, which is a critical Asset.
  - User Creation: We created a new user in phpMyAdmin and assigned specific passwords.
  - Securing Root: We added a password to the root@localhost account to prevent unauthorized access.
  - Authentication Config: We modified config.inc.php to strengthen the login system:
    - `auth_type` = 'cookie': This forces the browser to show a login screen instead of logging in automatically.
    - `AllowNoPassword` = false: This prevents users without passwords from entering the database.

#### Key Security Lessons
- Prevention: Stopping threats by closing "holes" like directory listing and empty passwords.
- Detection: Monitoring how the system reacts to different URLs and login attempts.
- Balance: We learned that security is a measurement that must be balanced with how easy the system is to use.
